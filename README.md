# Winston Transport for Knex

<!-- ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/winston-knex?style=flat-square) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/winston-knex?style=flat-square) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/aldy505/winston-knex?style=flat-square) -->

This module is here because I can't find Knex Transport that supports Winston 3.x, so I made one.

This is still a work in progress. If you want to collaborate, please create a new issue. I can't test all the database provided by Knex, I only can do mysql, postgres, and sqlite, all help would be welcome.
